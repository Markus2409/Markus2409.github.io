# Bachelorâ€™s Thesis in Biotechnology

## Abstract
This thesis organizes and shares **neurophysiology** data recorded in areas **V6A, PE, and PEc** of *Macaca fascicularis*, converting them into **HDF5** for reproducible analyses (MATLAB/Python). Data quality (e.g., ISI violations), eye movements, and raster/PSTH during reaching tasks in darkness are assessed, with the aim of promoting **data sharing** and applications in BCI and translational medicine.
