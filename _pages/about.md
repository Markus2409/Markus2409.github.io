My name is MarcoðŸ˜Ž. Ever since I got my hands on my fatherâ€™s first computer, Iâ€™ve been passionate about technology and programming. Over time, I decided to combine this love for computer science ðŸ‘¾ with my fascination for biology ðŸ¦ . I graduated in Biotechnology (2024) with a thesis in bioinformatics focused on the analysis of neuroelectrophysiology data ðŸ§ , and I am now pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Bioinformatics at the Department of Pharmacy and Biotechnology (FaBiT), Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna, Italy. My main interest is applying computational and programming skills to biotechnology and omics sciences.
